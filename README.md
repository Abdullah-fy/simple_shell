# Simple Shell Project
The project involves building a basic shell using the C language.

The project will have a prompt where users can enter commands. When a command is entered, it will understand it and perform the requested action. This can include running system commands or executing other programs.

The project will support features like running commands in the background, redirecting input and output to files, and connecting multiple commands together. It will also provide basic editing capabilities for the command line.

The goal is to create a simple, user-friendly shell that allows users to interact with the computer using familiar commands. It will handle errors and signals appropriately to provide a smooth experience.

Overall, the project aims to create a functional shell program using the C language that users can use to run commands and interact with the computer.
